# File And Folder Organization

This repo is a small pnpm workspace with two app targets:

- `apps/desktop` is the actual Philo desktop app.
- `apps/landing` is the marketing site.

If you are making product changes, most of the time you will be working inside `apps/desktop`.

## Top Level

```text

├── apps/
├── docs/
├── scripts/

├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── turbo.json
├── dprint.json
└── README.md
```

## What Each Top-Level Folder Is For

- `apps/`
  - Workspace packages.
  - `desktop` is the Tauri app.
  - `landing` is the Astro site.
- `docs/`
  - Internal documentation like architecture notes.
- `scripts/`
  - Repo-level utility scripts, including release verification.
- `vendor/`
  - Vendored upstream code. In this repo that is mostly `vendor/hyprnote`.
  - It is shared reference code, not the main place for Philo-specific product work.
- `dist/`
  - Generated build output.
- `node_modules/`, `.turbo/`
  - Generated dependency/cache folders.

## Desktop App Layout

The desktop app is split into a web frontend and a Rust/Tauri backend:

```text
apps/desktop/
├── src/
├── src-tauri/
├── public/
├── scripts/
├── vite.config.ts
└── package.json
```

## `apps/desktop/src`

This is the React/TypeScript side of the desktop app.

### Main entry files

- `main.tsx`
  - Frontend bootstrapping.
- `App.tsx`
  - Top-level React app shell.
- `App.css`
  - App-wide frontend styles.

### `components/`

UI components, grouped by feature area.

- `components/layout/`
  - App shell, top-level timeline layout, global search, modal wiring.
- `components/journal/`
  - Daily note editing and note-specific UI.
- `components/editor/`
  - Shared editor UI and custom TipTap extensions.
- `components/library/`
  - Widget library UI.
- `components/settings/`
  - Settings modal and setup UI.
- `components/onboarding/`
  - First-run vault/journal configuration flow.
- `components/ai/`
  - AI-related UI pieces.
- `components/shared/`
  - Reusable shared components.

### `services/`

Non-UI application logic. This is where most filesystem and domain behavior lives.

- `storage.ts`
  - Daily note read/write logic.
- `paths.ts`
  - Resolves journal/vault paths and note filenames.
- `obsidian.ts`
  - Obsidian vault detection and bootstrap helpers.
- `images.ts`
  - Asset saving and asset URL resolution.
- `excalidraw.ts`
  - Excalidraw embed resolution/render helpers.
- `mentions.ts`
  - Mention parsing and markdown conversions.
- `tasks.ts`
  - Rollover and recurring-task behavior.
- `library.ts`
  - Widget library persistence.
- `generate.ts`, `assistant.ts`
  - AI/widget generation logic.
- `settings.ts`
  - Persistent settings access.
- `updater.ts`
  - Desktop update handling.
- `format.ts`
  - Note formatting helpers.

### `lib/`

Low-level shared utilities used across features.

- `markdown.ts`
  - The TipTap JSON <-> markdown conversion layer.

### `hooks/`

React hooks for app-level state derived from the environment.

- `useCurrentDate.ts`
- `useTimezoneCity.ts`

### `types/`

Small shared type definitions.

- `note.ts`
  - Daily note shape and date helpers.

### `assets/`

Static frontend assets imported by the desktop app.

## `apps/desktop/src-tauri`

This is the native shell and backend side of the desktop app.

```text
apps/desktop/src-tauri/
├── src/
├── icons/
├── capabilities/
├── Cargo.toml
├── tauri.conf.json
└── tauri.dev.conf.json
```

### Important files

- `src/lib.rs`
  - Main Tauri command handlers and desktop-native logic.
  - Filesystem commands, search indexing, Obsidian detection, window behavior, menu wiring.
- `src/main.rs`
  - Rust entrypoint.
- `Cargo.toml`
  - Rust dependencies and package metadata.
- `tauri.conf.json`
  - Desktop app packaging/runtime config.
- `capabilities/default.json`
  - Tauri capability configuration.
- `icons/`
  - App icons for different platforms.

### Generated / build output inside `src-tauri`

- `target/`
  - Rust build output.
- `gen/`
  - Generated Tauri artifacts.

These are not the main places to make hand edits.

## Landing Site Layout

`apps/landing` is much smaller and follows the usual Astro split:

- `src/pages/`
  - Route files.
- `src/content/blog/`
  - Blog posts.
- `public/`
  - Static files.

## Vendored Code

`vendor/hyprnote` is a vendored upstream codebase that Philo borrows from for editor styling and some file-saving behavior.

In practice:

- Philo-specific app work should usually start in `apps/desktop`.
- Only touch `vendor/hyprnote` if the change genuinely belongs in the vendored upstream layer.

## Rule Of Thumb For New Code

- UI or interaction change: `apps/desktop/src/components`
- Filesystem or note behavior: `apps/desktop/src/services`
- Markdown/editor round-trip behavior: `apps/desktop/src/lib/markdown.ts` or `components/editor`
- Native desktop command or OS integration: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- Marketing site content or pages: `apps/landing`
- Internal explanations: `docs`

## Folders You Usually Ignore While Editing

- `node_modules/`
- `.turbo/`
- `dist/`
- `apps/desktop/dist/`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/`

Those are generated outputs, caches, or installed dependencies rather than source-of-truth code.
