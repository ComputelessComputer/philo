A note-taking app that builds things for you.

Write your notes, then hit **⇧⌘↵** to generate a custom mini-app — a calorie tracker, a world clock, a habit chart — embedded right inside your document.

## How it works

1. **Write** — take notes in a block-based editor
2. **Generate** — describe what you need and press Shift+Cmd+Enter
3. **Use** — an interactive widget appears inline in your notes
4. **Keep or toss** — widgets are disposable by default. Save the ones you like to your library and reuse them anywhere.

## Use cases

- **Personal dashboards** — embed a habit tracker, mood logger, or daily planner directly in your journal
- **Quick tools** — need a unit converter or tip calculator? Generate it on the spot
- **Study aids** — create flashcard widgets, spaced repetition timers, or formula reference cards
- **Project planning** — spin up a kanban board, countdown timer, or progress tracker inside your project notes
- **Health & fitness** — calorie counters, water intake trackers, workout logs — all inline
